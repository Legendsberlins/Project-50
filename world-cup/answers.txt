Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: None of the predictions proved incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:It seems like the predictions stabilized after after 100 simulations
